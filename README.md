# REST API for New Zealand Walking Trails  

This project is a REST API developed for the NZWalks application, which manages information about walking trails in New Zealand.  

The key features I implemented include:  

**Authorization and Authentication**: Using JWT tokens to secure the API.  

**Data Validation**: Implementing validation rules for model and request data.  

**Sorting, Filtering, and Pagination**: Flexible data retrieval with options for sorting, filtering by criteria, and pagination.  

**Image Uploading**: Enabling the upload of trail images and storing them on the server.  

**AutoMapper**: Automatic mapping between entity and DTO (Data Transfer Object) models for code optimization.  

This API is designed to be easily integrated with client applications, providing all necessary functionalities for managing trail data.
